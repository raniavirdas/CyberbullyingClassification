# Predict Multi Cyberbullying Tweets
## Background
Twitter is an online social networking and microblogging service that allows its users to send and read text-based messages. However, many Twitter users use the social network to do bad things such as criticizing, racism, and even bullying others. 
This project aims to predict cyberbullying tweets using multiclassifier.

</p>

Users who do not justify cyberbullying behavior tweet by including the word bully in the sentences they type. As well as for users who do cyberbullying with other categories. Not only that, the word fuck is also typed when other users are cyberbullying in other categories
## Pre-processing
I removed stopwords, case folding, stemming, and lemmatizer words as follows.
|tweet_text|cyberbullying_type|clean_tweet|
|:-|:-|:-|
|In other words #katandandre, your food was cra...|not_cyberbullying|word food crapilici|
## Features Engineering
I did TDIDF method on feature extraction
## Model Development & Evaluation
- Model: I use Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, and Multinomial Na√Øve Bayes classifier
- Evalualtion: I used a cv score with the best parameters and the result was that SVC produced the best performance with a cv score of 0.833 with a penalty parameter of the error term of 1
## Conclusion
The support vector machine is the best machine learning model for predicting cyberbullying tweets with 83% of accuracy. It has a weighted average precision percentage of 82%. Even so, the sensitivity obtained is 83%. It means that about 17% of positive cases missed the model's predictions
